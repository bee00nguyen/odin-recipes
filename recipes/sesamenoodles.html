    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Noodles dressed with sesame are popular in many parts of China, but this particular style, made with peanut butter and served cold, became a Chinese-American staple in the United States in the 1970s. The family of Shorty Tang — an ambitious restaurateur who emigrated from Sichuan to Taipei to New York — firmly believes that he invented the dish and still serve it at Hwa Yuan, the restaurant he opened in 1967 in Manhattan’s Chinatown. They have never divulged the exact recipe; this is our own lush but refreshing version. —Sam Sifton</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound noodles, frozen or (preferably) fresh</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil, plus a splash</li>
        <li>3 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. They should retain a hint of chewiness. Drain, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame paste, peanut butter, sugar, ginger, garlic and chili-garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss. Transfer to a serving bowl, and garnish with cucumber and peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
